yasnippets snippet definitions for use with Ruby on Rails

for information on yasnippets see http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/
for information on Ruby on Rails see http://www.rubyonrails.org/

Not all emacs configurations default to making rails-snippets available by default.  Every emacs configuration, for ruby,  I have tried makes the ruby-mode options available for yasnippets.  So the dirfolder yasnippets-rails/rails-snippets/ruby-mode/ now contains the bundled ruby-mode with rails-mode and rhtml-mode snippets.    The snippets are subdivided by the yasnippets 'group's instead of dirfolders.  You can use symbolic links and add back the other modes, if needed.

#		  in a Ruby on Rails project, specifically in .rhtml files
#		  alongside Rhtml-Mode or MuMaMo-Mode

#    - rails-snippets: the actual directory of snippets
